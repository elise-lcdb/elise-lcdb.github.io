        <h2>History of Raspberry Pi</h2>
        <p>The Raspberry Pi was created in Febuary 2012 by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Oringially setup to promote and teach basic cimputer science in schools and colleges around the UK. They initially released 2 Devices the Model A and the Model B, these computers ranged in spec and cabilities. Soon after the release of these products a community was formed and thousends of “Tech-Heads” (Including me!) bought one and started to create new projects with it, for instance one of the first things I did was setup a Home Media Centre and played the popular game Minecraft.
            The products were so popular due to their cost ranging from $25 – $35 (£17 – £23) they were efficient and durable which made them easy to modify and crate projects on, The device ran Linux a popular OS for developers due to it being open-source.
